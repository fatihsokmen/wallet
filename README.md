# Deblock Wallet


## Things to improve/consider 

- Input field can be supported by `VisualTransformation`s that we can format/mask text value
- Should be enough ETH to cover transfer? I skip it in the example.
- When `Max X ETH` text should be clickable as other defi wallets.
- Gas fee shoould be updated after a time span. (ex: 5 sec)
